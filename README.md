## Installation Guide

Bridge comes as a pymol plugin and depends on MDAnalysis (0.19.2+). 
To install pymol, we recommend using the miniconda python distribution 
(https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). If miniconda is set up 
correctly you can install pymol and MDAnalysis with:

> conda install -c schrodinger pymol <br/>
> conda install -c conda-forge mdanalysis

To open pymols plugin manager, click

> Plugin->Plugin Manager

In the plugin manager, go to the 'Install New Plugin' tab and click 
'Choose file ...'. Select the .zip file containing Bridge and restart
pymol. Now start Bridge by clicking

> Plugin->Bridge
